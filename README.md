**Tools for 2D mouse brain registration to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF)**

Adapted from [allenCCF](https://github.com/cortex-lab/allenCCF) - A comprehensive toolkit for registering histological brain slices to the Allen Brain Atlas and analyzing spatial distributions of cells and regions of interest.

## Features

- **Automated brain slice registration** to Allen CCF coordinates
- **Interactive MATLAB GUI** for manual registration refinement
- **ROI analysis** with spatial coordinate extraction
- **Batch processing** support for whole-brain datasets
- **Multiple imaging modalities** (fluorescence, DAPI, multi-channel)
- **Flexible data structure** for various experimental workflows

## Quick Start
